# 🕹️ Tic Tac Toe V1.0 – 20 Games Challenge (Game 5)

This is the **fifth** game in my [20 Games Challenge](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/challenge/#5) — a personal journey to improve my game development skills by creating 20 small games from scratch.

## 🎮 Game Overview
**Tic Tac Toe** is a simple yet classic turn-based strategy game. Two players take turns placing their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 board, aiming to align three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

My version of the game is built in Unity using C#, featuring multiple **AI** difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard) and an **online** lobby where you can instantly play with **random** people.
